# Activity 11 Reflection – React Tic-Tac-Toe

## What was the goal of this activity?
The goal of this activity was to learn how to build a simple game using React. I learned how to use components, state, and props to control the game. I also learned how to update the UI automatically when the state changes.

## What did I learn from this activity?
From this activity, I learned:
- How to create React components such as Square, Board, and Game.
- How to use useState to manage the game state.
- How to pass data using props.
- How React re-renders the UI when the state changes.
- How to handle click events in React.
- How to build a small game using modern JavaScript and React.

## What challenges did I face?
At first, I had trouble understanding how state works in React. I also found it confusing to pass data between components. After practicing and reading the code carefully, I understood better how parent and child components work together.

## How did I solve the problems?
I solved the problems by:
- Re-reading the tutorial.
- Testing the code step by step.
- Checking the console for errors.
- Asking for help when I was stuck.

## What did I like about this activity?
I liked that I could build a real working game using React. I also liked the move history feature because it shows how powerful React state management is.

## Conclusion
This activity helped me understand the basics of React. I now feel more comfortable using components and state. This will help me in future web development projects.
